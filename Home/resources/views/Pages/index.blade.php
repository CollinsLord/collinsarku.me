				<p>
          I am a software engineer that has skills in both the back-end of web application
          and the front-end.My previous career as a designer brought me close to
          my true passion building web applications.I wasn't satisfied with only being involved in 
          the visual aspect I wanted a deeper involvement in building out applictions.
          In the next phase of my career,I do not only want to use my desing skills to make 
          the application looks splendid, but I also want to work on the technically challenging facet of the application too.
          I would love to work as team that fellow best practices like Test Driven Development and pair programming to help 
          me learn and grow as a developer.
