              I am a developer with experience in my field.I currently leave in Accra Ghana,
            I have built several projects on my own from scratch and work with other developers on projects.
              I think my experience in the industry and my ability to work autonomously 
              make me a good developer to work as an individual or within a team.
              I have the savvy, experience and superior communication ability to be an asset to you as well as your company.
              Please feel free to checkout my projects  I have worked on <a href="#">Github</a> or on my project page
              If you have a project you wish to discuss or work with me you can get in touch with me on my <a href="/contact">Contact me </a>
