              I am a developer based in Accra Ghana,with experience in Web designing and Application development, 
              I have built several projects on my own from scratch and work with other developers on some few projects.
              <p>I think my experience in the industry and my ability to work autonomously 
              make me a good developer to work as an individual or within a team.</p>
              I have the savvy, experience and superior communication ability to be an asset to you as well as your company.
              Please feel free to checkout my projects  I have worked on <a href="https://github.com/CollinsLord" style="color:Blue">Github</a> or on my project page.
